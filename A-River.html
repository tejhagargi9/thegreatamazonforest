          Fact 3: The Amazon River discharges more water than any other river in
          the world, with an average discharge of approximately 209,000 cubic
          meters per second. This accounts for about one-fifth of the world's
          total river flow.

          Fact 4: The river has over 1,100 tributaries, with 17 of them being
          over 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) long. These tributaries contribute
          to the immense volume of water carried by the Amazon River.

          Fact 5: The Amazon River is home to the Amazon River dolphin, also
          known as the pink dolphin. This unique species is known for its
          distinctive pink color and is one of the few freshwater dolphin
          species in the world.

          Fact 6: During the wet season, the Amazon River can expand to over 30
          miles (48 kilometers) in width. This vast expanse of water transforms
          the surrounding rainforest, creating a seasonal floodplain that
          supports diverse ecosystems.
