          <b>Fact 1:</b> The Amazon Forest is often referred to as the "lungs of
          the planet" because it produces over 20% of the world's oxygen. It
          plays a crucial role in the global oxygen and carbon cycles, absorbing
          large amounts of carbon dioxide and helping to mitigate climate
          change.

          <b>Fact 2:</b> The Amazon Rainforest is home to more than 400 billion
          individual trees belonging to 16,000 different species. It is
          estimated that there are around 10 million species of animals, plants,
          and insects living in the Amazon, many of which are still undiscovered
          by scientists.

          <b>Fact 4:</b> Covering over 5.5 million square kilometers, the Amazon
          Rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world. This vast
          area is essential for maintaining biodiversity and supporting numerous
          indigenous communities who rely on the forest for their livelihoods
          and cultural practices.
